Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Surfs Up Analysis Summary

Overall the temperatures are very similiar between June and December. There is only an average change in tempature of ~3 degrees between June and December. Oahu is warm year-round so opening an surf and ice cream shop in Oahu would be sustainable. 

Two addtional queries to consider before opening a surf and ice cream shop are:
- What is the precipitation between June and December? Would the change in weather affect the waves for surfing, the amount of tourists due to precipitation, and desire for ice cream?
- What is the likelihood of a storm between June and December? Would hurricane season lower the amount of tourists for the shop?
